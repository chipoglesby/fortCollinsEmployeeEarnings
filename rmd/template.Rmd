## Salary Data

The Fort Collins `r paste(i, sep = "")` reports 
`r salaries %>% filter(serviceArea == i) %>% summarize(count = n())` employees on
staff in 2015. Of those employees the highest paid position is the
`r salaries %>% filter(serviceArea == i) %>% top_n(1, earnings) %>% select(jobTitle)` with
an annual salary of 
`r paste("$", salaries %>% filter(serviceArea == i) %>% top_n(1, earnings) %>% select(earnings), sep = "")`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
salaries %>% 
  filter(serviceArea == i) %>%
  group_by(jobTitle) %>% 
  summarize(earnings = mean(earnings)) %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(reorder(jobTitle, earnings), earnings)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Job Title") +
  ylab("Salary - mean") + 
  coord_flip()
```
